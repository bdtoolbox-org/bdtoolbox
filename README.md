# Brain Dynamics Toolbox

##Version 2018a
Not yet released.

The [Brain Dynamics Toolbox](http://bdtoolbox.blogspot.com) is open-source software for simulating dynamical systems in neuroscience. It is for researchers and students who wish to explore mathematical models of brain function using Matlab. It includes a graphical tool for simulating dynamical systems in real-time as well as command-line tools for scripting large-scale simulations. 

The toolbox supports the major classes of dynamical systems that typically arise in computational neuroscience. Specifically Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), Delay Differential Equations (DDE) and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE).
Nonetheless it can also be applied to dynamical systems from any discipline.

## Getting Started
The toolbox requires MATLAB 2014b or newer. It will not work with Octave.
Download the sample chapter of the *Handbook for the Brain Dynamics Toolbox* from [http://bdtoolbox.blogspot.com](http://bdtoolbox.blogspot.com) and follow the instructions in the *Getting Started* section.
