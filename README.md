##Version 2018a
Released 20 Mar 2018.

The [Brain Dynamics Toolbox](http://www.bdtoolbox.org) is an open-source software toolbox for simulating dynamical systems in neuroscience. It is for students and researchers who wish to explore numerical models of brain function using Matlab. It includes a graphical platform that brings differential equations to life as interactive simulations, and includes command-line tools for scripting large-scale simulations in batch mode.
